Next Steps 
- items need attributes in store (hover to show?)
- buy and sell gundams
    - import and display user gundams 
    - (make methods for delete, post, patch)

- next level of opponents (wave  = user level)
    - less than logic to update user level
    - prize a multiple of level
    - change battlefield to have a start battle button in addition to choose gundam, set currentbattle level (choosen by user)
